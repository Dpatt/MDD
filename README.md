repo for 1307 Mobile Device Deployment course

Github was simple to install. By doing to github.com and adding my new user information I was directed to the download menu where I download the latest version for mac. The wizard prompt me to install and pick my location for where I'd like github to be installed on my system. I went with storing github in my application folder. After that the installation was complete.
